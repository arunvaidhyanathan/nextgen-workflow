Part 1: The OpenAPI Specification Plan
The OpenAPI specification will describe the external-facing API surface, as exposed by the API Gateway. It is the single source of truth for the headless UI developers. It will not describe the internal, service-to-service APIs (e.g., the calls from OneCMS to the Core Workflow Engine).

I. Guiding Principles for the OpenAPI Spec
Consumer-First Design: The spec will be designed from the perspective of the UI developer. Endpoints will be intuitive and resource-oriented (e.g., focusing on Cases and Worklists, not ProcessInstances).
Strict Contract: It will be a complete and formal contract, including clear schemas, examples, and error responses for every endpoint.
Domain-Driven: The resources and endpoints will reflect the business domain of the OneCMS Service, not the technical details of the workflow engine.
Security-Defined: Every endpoint will be clearly marked with its security requirements (i.e., requires a JWT).
II. Structure of the OpenAPI 3.0 YAML File
Here is the planned structure for your openapi.yaml.

1. Metadata (info block)
Title: NextGen Workflow API
Version: 1.0.0
Description: The official RESTful API for the OneCMS application. It provides all necessary endpoints for case creation, management, user worklists, and administration. All requests must be authenticated via a JWT Bearer token.
Contact: Details for the development team.
2. Servers (servers block)
This will define the base URLs for different environments, allowing developers to easily switch between local, development, and production.
url: http://localhost:8080/api (Local Development)
3. Security Schemes (components/securitySchemes block)
A single scheme will be defined for JWT authentication.
Name: BearerAuth
Type: http
Scheme: bearer
Bearer Format: JWT
This will enable the "Authorize" button in Swagger UI.
4. Tags (Endpoint Grouping)
Tags are crucial for organizing the API into logical sections. The following tags will be used:

Authentication: For user login and token management.
Cases: Core endpoints for creating and managing cases.
Allegations: Endpoints for managing allegations within a case.
Narratives: Endpoints for managing narratives within a case.
Worklist: The most important tag for end-users, representing their task list.
Users & Entitlements: Admin-level endpoints for managing users, roles, and departments.
Reference Data: Endpoints for fetching static data (e.g., lists of departments, allegation types).
5. Paths (The Endpoints)
This is the core of the API definition, structured by the tags above.

Authentication (/auth)
POST /auth/login: Accepts username/password, returns a JWT.
Cases (/cms/cases)
POST /cms/cases: Create a new case.
GET /cms/cases: List/search cases with pagination and filters.
GET /cms/cases/{caseId}: Get a single case by its ID.
PUT /cms/cases/{caseId}: Update a case's core details.
Allegations (/cms/cases/{caseId}/allegations)
POST /cms/cases/{caseId}/allegations: Add a new allegation to a case.
GET /cms/cases/{caseId}/allegations: List all allegations for a case.
PUT /cms/cases/{caseId}/allegations/{allegationId}: Update an allegation.
Worklist (/cms/worklist)
GET /cms/worklist/my-tasks: (Key Endpoint) Get the current authenticated user's list of actionable tasks. The response will be an aggregated DTO combining workflow data with case data.
POST /cms/worklist/tasks/{taskId}/claim: Claim a task from a queue.
POST /cms/worklist/tasks/{taskId}/complete: Complete a claimed task, submitting data.
POST /cms/worklist/tasks/{taskId}/unclaim: Release a claimed task back to its queue.
6. Schemas (components/schemas block)
To ensure consistency and reusability, all DTOs will be defined here.

Case, CaseSummary
Allegation
Narrative
User, Role, Department
WorklistItem: The rich, aggregated object returned by the /my-tasks endpoint.
Request Bodies: CreateCaseRequest, CompleteTaskRequest, etc.
Responses: LoginResponse, PagedCaseResponse, etc.
ApiError: A standardized error response schema for all 4xx/5xx errors.
Part 2: The Postman Collection Plan
The Postman collection is designed for end-to-end (E2E) testing and developer onboarding. It will tell a story, with each request building on the previous one using variables.

I. Guiding Principles for the Postman Collection
Narrative Flow: The collection will be organized into folders that represent a logical user journey, from setup to case completion.
Variable-Driven: It will make heavy use of collection and environment variables ({{baseUrl}}, {{jwt_token}}, {{caseId}}) to chain requests together seamlessly.
Self-Contained: It will include requests to set up any prerequisite data, making it runnable in a clean environment.
Richly Documented: Every folder and request will have a Markdown description explaining its purpose, the required state, and what to check for in the response.
II. Structure of the Postman Collection
1. Collection-Level Configuration
Variables:
baseUrl: e.g., http://localhost:8080/api
jwt_analyst, jwt_investigator, jwt_director: To store tokens for different user personas.
caseId, processInstanceId, taskId: To be set and used dynamically during the E2E flow.
Authorization: The default authorization method will be set to "Bearer Token" with the token value {{jwt_analyst}}. Individual requests can override this if needed.
2. Folder Structure (The Narrative)
üìÅ 01 - Authentication

Description: "Start here. Use these requests to obtain JWTs for different user roles. The Tests tab automatically saves the token to a collection variable."
Requests:
POST Login as Intake Analyst: Logs in alice.intake.
POST Login as Investigator: Logs in edward.inv.
POST Login as Manager: Logs in frank.mgr.
üìÅ 02 - Admin & Setup (Prerequisites)

Description: "Run these requests if you are in a clean environment to create the necessary roles and departments for the E2E flow."
Requests:
POST Create Department - HR
POST Create Role - INTAKE_ANALYST
üìÅ 03 - E2E Case Workflow: Financial Fraud

Description: "This folder simulates the entire lifecycle of a standard Financial Fraud case, from creation to closure."
Sub-folders:
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stage 1: Case Intake (As Intake Analyst)
Description: "Ensure you are using the jwt_analyst token."
POST Create New Case: Creates a case with a "Financial Fraud" allegation. The Tests script saves the new caseId to a variable.
GET My Worklist: Shows the "EO Intake - Initial Review" task. The Tests script saves the taskId.
POST Claim Intake Task: Claims the task using the {{taskId}} variable.
POST Complete Intake Task: Submits the task for routing.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stage 2: Departmental Review (As Legal Counsel)
Description: "Switch to the jwt_legal_counsel token. This stage simulates the multi-department subprocess."
GET My Worklist: Shows the "Assign to LEGAL" task. Save the new taskId.
POST Claim and Complete Legal Review Task: Claims and completes the departmental review.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stage 3: Investigation (As Investigator)
Description: "Switch to the jwt_investigator token."
GET My Worklist: Shows the "Draft Investigation Plan" task.
POST Complete Draft IP (Validation Fail): A request with invalid data to demonstrate the validation loop.
POST Complete Draft IP (Validation Pass): A request with valid data to move the workflow forward.
...and so on, following the BPMN flow to completion.
üìÅ 04 - Authorization & Error Tests

Description: "These requests are designed to fail. They test the security and error handling of the API."
Requests:
[403] Investigator Tries to Create Case
[403] Intake Analyst Tries to Assess Findings
[401] Get Case with Invalid Token
[400] Create Case with Missing Title
This structured plan will give you a professional, robust, and easy-to-use OpenAPI specification and a Postman collection that not only tests your application but also serves as living documentation for your API.

Expanded OpenAPI Specification Plan

4. Schemas (components/schemas block)
No changes needed here, as the schemas you already defined (and new entities for departments and user_departments) should cover all parameters needed for the new endpoints.

Expanded Postman Collection Plan
Here's the updated Postman collection structure to ensure all key functionalities are tested.
These are some additional things we need to check for the API requests.

Validate that each test should validate,
The success/failure scenarios
The request parameter passed is correct.
Headers and the response body is what is expected.
Folder Structure Updates
In 00.Configuration check for auth.

        üìÑ  Task Missing Parameter [Fail]
        üìÑ  Invalid Role [Fail]
Key Changes & Additions:

Configuration > Get Auth Tokens:
Adds individual login requests for "HR Specialist", "Legal Counsel", "Security Analyst", etc., and stores their tokens in collection variables. (Added auth test at the beginning to make sure is valid)
This is to make sure the service user has proper tokens to make certain API requests.
This lets you dynamically use different roles in the later folders.
Admin & Setup > Add these three requests:
Create "Test-Case" Role to CMS service: Checks user creation, request parameter validation.
Assign "Test-Case" to new user in CMS: Verifies new user has new Role.
Delete "Test-Case" role from CMS: test RBAC enforcement and see what happens to user
Add New Folder: Authorization Testing
This will explicitly test that Cerbos policies are working correctly by calling endpoints with tokens for unauthorized users.
GET My Worklist [Fail 403]: As a Senior Director, try to get the HR intake queue (should be rejected).
GET List of cases [Fail 403]: As Intake analyst should fail since that permission is assigned to other.
Add a section to validate if the request and API requests returns with the success of what is expected or error or not.
