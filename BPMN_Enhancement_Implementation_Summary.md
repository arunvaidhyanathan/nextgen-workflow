## Implemented Improvements

### ✅ 1. Missing Process Steps and Tasks
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Added Tasks:
- **EO Flow**: Added "Enter Information" task after "Create a New Case"
- **CSIS Flow**: Separated combined steps, added proper enter information flows
- **Investigation Flow**: Enhanced task names for clarity

#### Specific Additions:
- `task_eo_enter_information` - Detailed case information entry
- `task_csis_manager_enter_info` - Manager information entry  
- `task_csis_analyst_enter_info` - Analyst information entry
- `task_er_enter_information` - ER case details entry
- `task_legal_enter_information` - Legal case details entry
- `task_investigator_create_plan` - Enhanced with "Initial Contact" specification

### ✅ 2. Missing Decision Options  
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Enhanced Decision Gateways:
- **EO Officer Actions**: Send to IU, Send Back to EO Intake, Save & Close, Cancel
- **CSIS Manager Actions**: Assign Analyst, Fast Track, Retain Intel, Save, Cancel  
- **CSIS Department Actions**: Assign, Send Back, Reroute, Save, Triage + Escalate
- **Investigation Manager Actions**: Send Back, Assign Investigator, Save
- **All User Tasks**: Save (draft), Save & Close (park), Cancel (abandon) options

#### Process Variables Added:
- `eoOfficerAction`, `csisMgrAction`, `csisAnalystAction`
- `invMgrAction`, `investigatorAction`
- User action variables for all roles and departments

### ✅ 3. Missing Parallel Flows
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Parallel Processing Implementation:
- **Parallel Gateway**: `gateway_parallel_departments` for multi-department routing
- **Parallel Join**: `gateway_parallel_join` to collect department results
- **Simultaneous Routing**: Cases can now be routed to CSIS, ER, and Legal simultaneously
- **Department Variables**: `departmentsInvolved` string to track active departments

#### Benefits:
- Eliminates bottlenecks from exclusive routing
- Enables true multi-department case processing
- Maintains workflow state across parallel paths

### ✅ 4. Missing User Actions/Buttons
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### User Action Categories:
```json
{
  "common": ["SAVE", "SAVE_CLOSE", "CANCEL"],
  "intake_actions": ["CREATE", "NOT_VALID", "OTHER_CORRESPONDENCE"],
  "triage_actions": ["ASSIGN", "SEND_BACK", "REROUTE", "ESCALATE", "FAST_TRACK", "RETAIN_INTEL"],
  "investigation_actions": ["ACCEPT", "REJECT", "CONTINUE", "FINALIZE"]
}
```

#### Implementation:
- All tasks now support Save (draft state)
- Save & Close creates parked state
- Cancel leads to cancellation end event
- Submit/Route proceeds to next workflow step

### ✅ 5. Missing Case States
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Case States Implemented:
1. **INTAKE** - Initial case received
2. **DRAFT** - Case saved but not submitted  
3. **PARKED** - Case saved and closed temporarily
4. **ACTIVE_INVESTIGATION** - Investigation in progress
5. **COMPLETED** - Case investigation finished
6. **CANCELLED** - Case abandoned or cancelled

#### State Management:
- Process variables track current state
- Execution listeners update state automatically
- New database table `case_state_transitions` for audit trail

### ✅ 6. Incomplete End States
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Multiple End Events:
1. **end_case_completed** - Successfully completed investigation
2. **end_case_cancelled** - Case cancelled/abandoned
3. **end_case_parked** - Case temporarily parked
4. **end_case_retained_intel** - CSIS intelligence retention
5. **end_case_sent_hr** - ER non-investigation HR handling
6. **end_case_not_valid** - Invalid case/other correspondence

#### Business Logic:
- Each end event represents specific business outcome
- Proper routing to appropriate end based on user actions
- Clear workflow completion scenarios

### ✅ 7. Missing Role Clarity  
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Role Distinctions:
- **EO Intake Analyst** - Initial case intake and creation
- **EO Head** - Strategic review and approval
- **EO Officer** - Triage and departmental routing
- **CSIS Intake Manager** - Security case management oversight
- **CSIS Intake Analyst** - Security analysis and vetting
- **ER Intake Analyst** - Employee relations processing
- **Legal Intake Analyst** - Legal review and compliance
- **Investigation Manager** - Investigation oversight and assignment
- **Investigator** - Case investigation execution

#### Clear Handoffs:
- Explicit lane assignments for each role
- Clear task ownership and responsibility
- Proper escalation paths between roles

### ✅ 8. Form Key Improvements
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Specific Form Keys:
```json
{
  "task_eo_intake_initial": "eo-initial-intake-form",
  "task_eo_create_new_case": "eo-create-case-form", 
  "task_eo_enter_information": "eo-case-details-entry-form",
  "task_csis_manager_create": "csis-manager-create-form",
  "task_investigator_create_plan": "investigator-plan-creation-form"
}
```

#### Benefits:
- UI can render appropriate forms for each task
- Form behavior matches user action requirements
- Clear mapping between BPMN tasks and UI components

### ✅ 9. Missing Subprocess Potential
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Investigation Subprocess:
- **subprocess_investigation** - Complete investigation execution
- **Timer Boundary Event** - 30-day escalation timer
- **Escalation Tasks** - Manager review on timer expiration
- **Investigation Loop** - Continue/Finalize decision points

#### Subprocess Components:
- Start/End events within subprocess
- Investigation conduct with timer escalation
- Escalation review task
- Investigation completion gateway
- Finalize investigation task

### ✅ 10. Data Flow Improvements
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Process Variables:
- **caseState** - Current case state tracking
- **casePriority** - Case priority level
- **departmentsInvolved** - Multi-department tracking
- **escalationLevel** - Escalation tracking
- **Action Variables** - All user action decisions

#### Timers and Escalations:
- **P30D** - Investigation escalation timer
- **SLA Minutes** - Task-specific SLA tracking
- **Escalation Config** - Multi-level escalation rules

#### Database Enhancements:
- `case_state_transitions` - State change audit
