**NextGen Workflow Application** - Streamlining case management and business process automation.

OneCMS: Unified Case Management Workflow - Technical & Business Overview
1. Executive Summary
This document provides a complete technical and business specification for the OneCMS Unified Case Management Workflow. This workflow is the core engine of the case management application, designed to handle the entire lifecycle of a case, from its initial creation to its final handoff for formal investigation.

The architecture is built on a set of core principles to ensure robustness, scalability, and clarity:

Unified but Specialized Intake: A centralized, multi-stage intake process managed by the Ethics Office (EO) ensures initial consistency for all externally reported cases.
Autonomous Departmental Initiation: Specialized departments, starting with CSIS, have the ability to initiate their own cases independently, following their unique internal procedures.
Intelligent, Rule-Based Routing: A central routing hub directs cases to the appropriate department (CSIS, ER, Legal) for specialized secondary intake.
Standardized Investigation Handoff: All paths, regardless of origin or departmental review, converge at a single, standardized point to hand off approved cases to the Investigation Unit. This ensures the formal investigation process is always initiated in a consistent manner.
This document serves as the definitive blueprint for developers, product owners, architects, and managers.

2. Parties & Personas
The workflow involves several key organizational units (Parties) and specific job functions (Personas/Roles) within them.

Party / Unit	Persona / Role	Key Responsibilities
Ethics Office (EO)	EO Intake Analyst	Initial case creation and data entry for externally reported cases.
EO Head	High-level validation and first-pass review of EO-initiated cases.
EO Officer	Central triage and routing authority for all EO-initiated cases.
CSIS	CSIS Intake Manager	Initiates cases, performs triage, assigns to analysts, and gives final approval for investigation.
CSIS Intake Analyst	Conducts detailed case vetting and makes recommendations for cases initiated by or routed to CSIS.
ER	ER Intake Analyst	Receives and reviews cases routed to Employee Relations, with the unique ability to assign directly to HR.
Legal	Legal Intake Analyst	Receives and reviews cases routed to the Legal department.
Investigation Unit	Investigation Manager	Receives approved cases from all intake paths and assigns them to a specific Investigator.
Investigator	Accepts case assignments, flags conflicts, and creates the formal investigation plan.

4. Detailed Step-by-Step Flow Description
This section provides a narrative explanation of the process depicted in the PlantUML diagram.

Phase 1: Case Origination
A case can enter the workflow through two distinct starting points:

Path A: EO-Initiated Intake (Externally Reported Cases)

Creation (EO Intake Analyst): An analyst receives an external report and creates a case, filling in all required initial information.
Validation (EO Head): The case is assigned to an EO Head who performs a high-level review. They can either Approve it for further triage or Reject it back to their own queue for re-evaluation.
Triage (EO Officer): An approved case goes to an EO Officer who makes the critical routing decision:
Send to IU: The case is valid and requires investigation. The Officer sets the targetUnit (CSIS, ER, or Legal) and sends it to the central routing hub.
Save & Close: The case is valid but requires no further action.
Send Back to Intake: The case is missing critical information and is sent back to the original creator.
Path B: CSIS Self-Initiated Intake

Start: A CSIS user initiates a case. The system checks their role.
Scenario 1 (Manager-led):
An Intake Manager creates the case and can either fast-track it directly to the Investigation Unit, close it for intelligence, or assign it to an Analyst for vetting.
The Analyst reviews the case and recommends it for investigation or rejects it back for more work.
The Manager gives a final Approve before sending it to the Investigation Unit.
Scenario 2 (Analyst-led):
An Intake Analyst creates the case and must submit it to a Manager for review.
The Manager reviews the analyst-created case and either Approves it for investigation or Rejects it back to the analyst for correction.
Phase 2: Departmental-Specific Intake
After the EO Officer routes a case via the central hub, it arrives at the designated department for their specialized intake.

If routed to CSIS: The case goes through the detailed three-phase Manager -> Analyst -> Manager review process. Key outcomes are sending back to the EO, re-routing to another IU, closing for intelligence, or approving for investigation.
If routed to ER: An ER Intake Analyst reviews the case. They can send it back to the EO, approve it for investigation, or use their unique option to Assign to HR, which closes the case from a workflow perspective.
If routed to Legal: A Legal Intake Analyst performs a streamlined review. They can either send it back to the EO or approve it for investigation.
Phase 3: Unified Investigation Handoff
This is the critical convergence point for the entire process. A case reaches this phase after it has been formally approved by CSIS, ER, or Legal.

Assignment Prep (Investigation Manager): An Investigation Manager receives the approved case. They perform a final review and prepare to assign it to a specific investigator. They can loop the case back to themselves if more information is needed before assignment.
Assignment Acceptance (Investigator): The assigned Investigator receives the case. This is a critical acceptance gate.
Accept: The Investigator accepts the assignment by selecting "Active Investigation".
Reject (Conflict/Unassign): If the Investigator has a conflict of interest or other issues, they reject the assignment, which sends the case back to the Investigation Manager to be reassigned to someone else.
Investigation Kick-off: Once an Investigator accepts the case, their first official task is to Create Investigation Plan. This marks the end of the intake and assignment process and the beginning of the formal investigation. The workflow, as defined here, concludes at this point.
5. Implementation Details for Developers
Process Variables
These variables are critical for controlling the flow through gateways. Forms associated with User Tasks must set these variables based on user actions.

Variable Name	Set By Task / Step	Expected Values	Purpose
creationAction	task_eo_createCase	CREATE, CANCEL	Controls initial EO case submission.
eoHeadAction	task_eo_headReview	APPROVE, REJECT	Controls EO Head's decision.
eoOfficerAction	task_eo_officerReview	SEND_TO_IU, SAVE_AND_CLOSE, SEND_BACK	Controls EO Officer's main triage decision.
targetUnit	task_eo_officerReview	CSIS, ER, LEGAL	Used with SEND_TO_IU to direct routing.
initiatorRole	(System) startCsisCase	MANAGER, ANALYST	Determines which CSIS-initiated scenario to run.
csisManagerAction1	task_csis_manager_review_1	ASSIGN, SEND_BACK, REROUTE, CLOSE	Controls CSIS Manager's first decision (EO path).
csisAnalystAction	task_csis_analyst_review	ESCALATE, RETAIN_INTEL	Controls CSIS Analyst's decision (EO path).
csisManagerAction2	task_csis_manager_review_2	APPROVE, REJECT	Controls CSIS Manager's final approval (EO path).
erIntakeAction	task_er_intake_review	ASSIGN_MANAGER, ASSIGN_HR, SEND_BACK	Controls ER Intake Analyst's decision.
legalIntakeAction	task_legal_intake_review	ASSIGN_MANAGER, SEND_BACK	Controls Legal Intake Analyst's decision.
invManagerAction	task_inv_manager_review	ASSIGN, SEND_BACK	Controls Investigation Manager's assignment decision.
investigatorAction	task_inv_investigator_review	ACCEPT, REJECT	Controls Investigator's case acceptance.
Role Management (RBAC)
User tasks are assigned to candidate groups. The application's security layer must map users to these groups.

GROUP_EO_INTAKE_ANALYST
GROUP_EO_HEAD
GROUP_EO_OFFICER
GROUP_CSIS_INTAKE_MANAGER
GROUP_CSIS_INTAKE_ANALYST
GROUP_ER_INTAKE_ANALYST
GROUP_LEGAL_INTAKE_ANALYST
GROUP_INVESTIGATION_MANAGER
GROUP_INVESTIGATOR
